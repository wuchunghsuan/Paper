\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present SCache, a cross-framework shuffle optimization for DAG computing frameworks. 
SCache decouples the shuffle from computing tasks and leverages memory to store shuffle data. 
By task pre-scheduling and shuffle data pre-fetching with application context, SCache significantly mitigates the shuffle overhead.

Our evaluations on Spark and Hadoop MapReduce with SCache show that SCache can provide a promising speedup. 
Furthermore, we propose \textit{Framework Resources Quantification} (FRQ) model to assist in analyzing shuffle process of DAG computing frameworks. At last we evaluate the SCache shuffle optimization by this practical model.
Therefore, with the shared defects of shuffle among different frameworks, we believe that the optimization of SCache is general and easy to adapt.
