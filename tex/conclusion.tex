\section{Conclusion}
 In this paper, we present SCache, a cross-framework open source shuffle optimization system for DAG computing frameworks. SCache decouples the shuffle from computing pipeline and leverages shuffle data pre-fetching to mitigate the I/O overhead of the whole system. By scheduling tasks with application context, SCache bridges the gap among computing stages.

 At the expense of inserting hundred lines of code, we adapt Spark and Hadoop Mapreduce to SCache. Our evaluation result shows that SCache can provide a promising speedup to the DAG framework. 
 Furthermore, we propose \textit{Framework Resources Quantification}(FRQ) model to assist in analyzing shuffle process of DAG computing frameworks. At last we use FRQ model to verify SCache shuffle optimization by mathematics.
 Therefore we believe that SCache is a simple and efficient system to enhance the performance of most DAG computing frameworks.
