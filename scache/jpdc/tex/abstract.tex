In large-scale data-parallel analytics, shuffle, namely the cross-network read and the aggregation of partitioned data between tasks with data dependencies, usually bring in large overhead.
% Due to the dependency constraints, execution of those descendant tasks could be delayed by long shuffles.
To reduce shuffle overhead, we present \textit{SCache}, an open-source plug-in system that particularly focuses on shuffle optimization. 
SCache adopts heuristic pre-scheduling combining with shuffle size prediction to pre-fetch shuffle data and balance load on each node. 
% By extracting and analyzing shuffle dependencies prior to the actual task execution, SCache can adopt heuristic pre-scheduling combining with shuffle size prediction to pre-fetch shuffle data and balance load on each node. 
Meanwhile, SCache takes full advantage of the system memory to accelerate the shuffle process.

% We have implemented SCache and customized Spark to use it as the external shuffle service and co-scheduler. The performance of SCache is evaluated with both simulations and testbed experiments on a 50-node Amazon EC2 cluster.
% Those evaluations have demonstrated that, by incorporating SCache, the shuffle overhead of Spark can be reduced by nearly $89\%$, and the overall completion time of TPC-DS queries improves $40\%$ on average.

We also propose a new performance model called \textit{Framework Resources Quantification} (FRQ) model to analyze DAG frameworks and evaluate the SCache shuffle optimization. 
The FRQ model quantifies the utilization of resources and predicts the execution time of each phase of DAG jobs. 
% We use the FRQ model to analyze DAG frameworks and evaluate the SCache shuffle optimization by mathematics.
We have implemented SCache on both Spark and Hadoop MapReduce. The performance of SCache has been evaluated with both simulations and testbed experiments on a 50-node Amazon EC2 cluster.
Those evaluations have demonstrated that, by incorporating SCache, the shuffle overhead of Spark can be reduced by nearly $89\%$, and the overall completion time of TPC-DS queries improves $40\%$ on average. On Apache Hadoop MapReduce, SCache optimizes end-to-end Terasort completion time by $15\%$.

% To optimize shuffle overhead in the DAG computing frameworks, we present SCache, an open source plug-in system. We also propose a new performance model called Framework Resources Quantification(FRQ) model. The FRQ model quantifies the utilization of resources and predicts the execution time of each phase of jobs. We use the model to analyze the deficiencies of the frameworks. SCache uses a heuristic pre-scheduling algorithm to pre-fetch shuffle data. Meanwhile, SCache uses memory to accelerate the shuffle process. We have implemented SCache on both Spark and Hadoop MapReduce. The performance of SCache has been evaluated on a 50-node Amazon EC2 cluster.
